This project is done as a part of Research Practice program. This project deals with Malware detection and classification using Images. 
The dataset used is Microsoft Big Data 2015 which contains ASM and BYTE files.
The above notebooks contain seperate code for generating RGB and Grayscale images.
The images are fed to a CNN and classification is being done.
Apart from Deep Learning, Machine Learning is also used. It consists of histogram based technique fed to famous ML models.
To do: Implement it with the help of other CNN models such as ResNet50 etc for both RGB and Grayscale images. Also generate images by using HOG and Gabor filter.
